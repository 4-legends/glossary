*Face detection* is the problem of detecting wheter an image has
a (usually human) face in it.

The problem of identifying whether the image has a specific
*single* person's face is called [face verification][1]. The problem
of identifying whether the image has any of $k$ person's faces
is called [face recognition][2].
