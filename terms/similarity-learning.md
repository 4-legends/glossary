*Similarity learning* is the area of machine learning
focusing on learning how similar or different two objects are.

Similarity learning is often used in areas of machine learning
where there are not a fixed number of classes that objects fit into.
[Face verification][1] is one example of such an area.

[Learning-to-rank][2] is another area of machine learning where
the model needs to learn a similarity function between the
pieces of data in the dataset.

[Distance metric learning][3] is related to similarity learning,
but where the similarity function is also required to obey the
four axioms of a [distance metric][4]. Outside of distance metric learning, similarity learning often
learns a pseudometric, where not all four axioms of a distance
metric are true.
