Face recognition is the problem of identifying whether an input
image contains the faces of any of $k$ people... or if the image has
none of the $k$ faces.

Face recognition is a harder problem than [face verification][1]
because face verification only compares a single image to one person,
whereas face recognition does this for $k$ people.
