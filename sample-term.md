This is a sample term that doesn't do anything real in machine learning glossary.
The point is to test the HTML we're generating.

# H1 header
Text below H1 header.

## H2 header
Text below H2 header.

### H3 header
Text below H3 header.

#### H4 header
Text below H4 header.

##### H5 header
Text below H5 header.

###### H6 header

This is some inline math ($\int_{-\inf}^{+\inf} x^2$) here.

Now we have some math in the center of the page:

$$
\int_{-\inf}^{+\inf} x^2
$$

> This is an important multi-line blockquote, containing lots of useful
> information.

Here we use backticks to show `some inline code`.

    This is a code block.

```
This is another code block
```

```python
def some_code(arg1, arg2):
    """
    This is a fenced code block with syntax highlighting.
    """
    return arg1 + arg2
```


Now we will show an image:

![This is a facet wrap as generated by the R package `ggplot2`. This image comes from [Plotting multiple groups with facets in ggplot2][1].](/images/faceting.png)

Now we will show some annoying custom HTML that we had to write:

<figure>
<div align="center">
 <img src="/images/starry_night_google.jpg" 
 alt="Vincent Van Gogh's famous artwork titled 'The Starry Night'"
 height="223px">
 <img src="/images/hoovertowernight.jpg"
 alt="A photograph of Hoover Tower on the Stanford University campus"
 height="223px">
</div>
<div align="center">
 <img src="/images/starry_stanford_bigger.png"
 alt="A synthetic image generated by Justin Johnson that depicts Stanford University's Hoover Tower using the style of Vincent van Gogh's 'The Starry Night'"
 width="710px">
</div>
<figcaption>
<p><b>Top Left:</b> Vincent Van Gogh's famous artwork titled <em>The Starry Night</em></p>
<p><b>Top Right:</b> A photograph of Hoover Tower on the Stanford University campus</p>
<p><b>Bottom:</b> A synthetic image generated by Justin Johnson that depicts Stanford University's
Hoover Tower using the style of Vincent van Gogh's <em>The Starry Night</em></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

Now we need some bullet points:

 - [skip-gram](/terms/skip-gram/), using a word to predict the surrounding $n$ words
 - [continuous-bag-of-words (CBOW)](/terms/continuous-bag-of-words-cbow), using the context of the surrounding
 $n$ words to predict the center word.

How about we use a numbered list instead:

1. **First cool thing:** This is the first thing that is cool.
2. **Second cool thing:** This thing is even cooler.

This is a somewhat complicated list:

+   First
+   Second:
    -   Fee
    -   Fie
    -   Foe

+   Third


Definition list

Term 1

:   Definition 1

Term 2 with *inline markup*

:   Definition 2

        { some code, part of Definition 2 }

    Third paragraph of definition 2.

Now we will try compact definition lists

Term 1
  ~ Definition 1

Term 2
  ~ Definition 2a
  ~ Definition 2b

Numbered example lists:

(@)  My first example will be numbered (1).
(@)  My second example will be numbered (2).

Explanation of examples.

(@)  My third example will be numbered (3).

Line blocks:

| The limerick packs laughs anatomical
| In space that is quite economical.
|    But the good ones I've seen
|    So seldom are clean
| And the clean ones so seldom are comical



Now we will show off a table


---------------------- ------------------- --------------------
                       **Actual Positive** **Actual Negative**
**Predicted Positive** True Positives      False Positives
**Predicted Negative** False Negatives     True Negatives
---------------------- ------------------- --------------------

How about another table?

: Sample grid table.

+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
| Fruit         | Price         | Advantages         |
+===============+===============+====================+
| Bananas       | $1.34         | - built-in wrapper |
|               |               | - bright color     |
+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
| Oranges       | $2.10         | - cures scurvy     |
|               |               | - tasty            |
+---------------+---------------+--------------------+

Here is a simpler table:

-------     ------ ----------   -------
     12     12        12             12
    123     123       123           123
      1     1          1              1
-------     ------ ----------   -------

-------------------------------------------------------------
 Centered   Default           Right Left
  Header    Aligned         Aligned Aligned
----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
   First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                    spans multiple lines.

  Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                    the blank line between
                                    rows.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Table: Here's the caption. It, too, may span
multiple lines.
