# $\nabla$ [Gradient]({% link terms/gradient.md %})
The $\nabla$ symbol when seen in front of a vector-valued function
like $\nabla f(x)$ refers to the function's gradient.

# $\odot$ [Hadamard Product]({% link terms/hadamard-product.md %})
This circle-dot symbol [can mean a few different things][1], depending on context.
Typically in machine learning literature, it refers to the Hadamard product
(component-wise multiplication for matrices).
