Beam search is memory-restricted version of breadth-first search.

Beam search commonly appears in machine translation or other literature where
[sequence-to-sequence](/terms/sequence-to-sequence-learning-seq2seq/) is common.
In this domain, beam search is used to increase the quality of the output sequence.
